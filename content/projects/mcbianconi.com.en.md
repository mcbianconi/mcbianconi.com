## About the project

This is the project for this website.

I decided to create a place where I could position myself in the way I thought was best. I think about posting some of my projects, my paintings and maybe some thoughts. Maybe give space to some friends’ vision.
Maybe I could spent time doing this on a social network, but I like the experience of maintaining an environment managed by me.

A bit controversial to use [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to do this, being a Python programmer? Maybe, but the truth is
I liked the way things work there and it challenges me to step out of my comfort zone and use some golang. The theme I chose to start with is [blowfish](https://blowfish.page/).

The project deploy is on CloudFlare and I manifest it in my infrastructure project: {{< article link="/en/projects/iac/" >}}
